00:00:0 --> 00:00:5,000
 Welcome back today I'm here with Jennifer Bull she is a client

2
00:00:5,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 of mine at the gym that I teach at and Jennifer today

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 we're here to talk about the transformation that you have made and

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 so many people struggle with trying to get healthy and fit and

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 they become imprisoned in their bodies. And they wake up every day

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 feeling like they don't wanna be in that body. Or. How did

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 it start free again. So. You know as an nurse practitioner I'm

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 trained actually with a license as an acute care nurse practitioner and

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 a family nurse practitioner and you know being a health care provider

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 we always think of that we know everything possible about house. And.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It just started to be where I was exhausted over the course

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:60,000
 of the past few years I was. To a point where I

13
00:00:60,000 --> 00:00:65,000
 was overweight and I just really needed something to change it was

14
00:00:65,000 --> 00:00:70,000
 to the point that I had really lost the person I've become

15
00:00:70,000 --> 00:00:75,000
 I've always been a really positive person very strong confident and I

16
00:00:75,000 --> 00:00:80,000
 just didn't have that anymore. And so it really came to the

17
00:00:80,000 --> 00:00:85,000
 point that you know I needed to find. Please that I wanted

18
00:00:85,000 --> 00:00:90,000
 to stop settling and I wanted to start living my dreams all

19
00:00:90,000 --> 00:00:95,000
 the things that I wanted to do I wasn't capable of doing

20
00:00:95,000 --> 00:00:100,000
 that where. Because of my weight and being so tired all the

21
00:00:100,000 --> 00:00:105,000
 time. And so I really thought to myself you know what it

22
00:00:105,000 --> 00:00:110,000
 this is it I have to find a better version of myself

23
00:00:110,000 --> 00:00:115,000
 and you know I wanted to be the author of a different

24
00:00:115,000 --> 00:00:120,000
 story so what I did was you know I embrace the pain

25
00:00:120,000 --> 00:00:125,000
 and I use that to really burn my fuel to be able

26
00:00:125,000 --> 00:00:130,000
 to drive a different course and so I started on a nutritional

27
00:00:130,000 --> 00:00:135,000
 cleansing program. And you know I released a total of 70 pounds

28
00:00:135,000 --> 00:00:140,000
 I now live in a different body where I have tons of

29
00:00:140,000 --> 00:00:145,000
 energy and mental clarity and I wake up like that every day

30
00:00:145,000 --> 00:00:150,000
 and you know now I how'd that better version of me you

31
00:00:150,000 --> 00:00:155,000
 know I am running 5 miles a day I'm lifting heavier in

32
00:00:155,000 --> 00:00:160,000
 the gym than I ever have been in achieving all the things

33
00:00:160,000 --> 00:00:165,000
 that I thought that were at the complete impossible. Right. So John

34
00:00:165,000 --> 00:00:170,000
 what was the secret for the new you so really what I

35
00:00:170,000 --> 00:00:175,000
 started was it it's the whole system and. It it's it's a

36
00:00:175,000 --> 00:00:180,000
 nutritional cleansing program and and what it really is it's it's a

37
00:00:180,000 --> 00:00:185,000
 roadmap that really can drive you to regain your overall health. And

38
00:00:185,000 --> 00:00:190,000
 that's what I love about it a you know it incorporates you

39
00:00:190,000 --> 00:00:195,000
 know in natural products I'm a but also a clean eating lifestyle

40
00:00:195,000 --> 00:00:200,000
 and you know so we when we think about all of these

41
00:00:200,000 --> 00:00:205,000
 fad diets out there you know everybody starts to engage on you

42
00:00:205,000 --> 00:00:210,000
 these type of fad diets and they lose a lot of we

43
00:00:210,000 --> 00:00:215,000
 and they become scale dependence and so what happens is they lose

44
00:00:215,000 --> 00:00:220,000
 all this weight but they don't realize that they're not only losing.

45
00:00:220,000 --> 00:00:225,000
 Facts but they're also breaking down their muscle and that puts their

46
00:00:225,000 --> 00:00:230,000
 body and a catabolic state and see what happens with that kind

47
00:00:230,000 --> 00:00:235,000
 of bollocks state is you know you're breaking down that fat and

48
00:00:235,000 --> 00:00:240,000
 muscle and that really shut down our metabolism so for people out

49
00:00:240,000 --> 00:00:245,000
 there what really happens is is that they start on these programs

50
00:00:245,000 --> 00:00:250,000
 and they lose everything but let me go back to normal eating

51
00:00:250,000 --> 00:00:255,000
 they regain all the weight and so than any year third 10

52
00:00:255,000 --> 00:00:260,000
 to 20 pounds heavier and then we'll go on a program again

53
00:00:260,000 --> 00:00:265,000
 and then we'll gain another 1020 pounds when they start to you

54
00:00:265,000 --> 00:00:270,000
 know eat differently again so this is really truly a lifestyle it's

55
00:00:270,000 --> 00:00:275,000
 not any type of back fat component at all. Well Jan you

56
00:00:275,000 --> 00:00:280,000
 look fantastic thank you. So who can benefit from this nutritional program.

57
00:00:280,000 --> 00:00:285,000
 So for this program there is a solution that for every minute

58
00:00:285,000 --> 00:00:290,000
 you know all of us out there have 3 different types of

59
00:00:290,000 --> 00:00:295,000
 challenges we I can benefit from weight loss we can benefit from

60
00:00:295,000 --> 00:00:300,000
 energy in performance and we can also benefit from healthy aging. So

61
00:00:300,000 --> 00:00:305,000
 you know what we find is that you know a lot of

62
00:00:305,000 --> 00:00:310,000
 athletes can benefit from the energy and performance perspective you know where

63
00:00:310,000 --> 00:00:315,000
 they can you deny on their running time and they can increase

64
00:00:315,000 --> 00:00:320,000
 their activity in their weights that they're doing in the jam and

65
00:00:320,000 --> 00:00:325,000
 then there's also you know different types of products that can help

66
00:00:325,000 --> 00:00:330,000
 you from a healthy aging perspective you know as well and then

67
00:00:330,000 --> 00:00:335,000
 you've got the weight loss component that I have you really demonstrated

68
00:00:335,000 --> 00:00:340,000
 with my own transformation so everyone can benefit from the program absolutely.

69
00:00:340,000 --> 00:00:345,000
 So what is the next main component of this program. The main

70
00:00:345,000 --> 00:00:350,000
 components of the program is a sh is a chic I minister

71
00:00:350,000 --> 00:00:355,000
 Sheikh program combined with a clean eating perspective and I'll go into

72
00:00:355,000 --> 00:00:360,000
 the cleaning perspective later on but no in regards to what that

73
00:00:360,000 --> 00:00:365,000
 the Sheik is a very different than you know a number of

74
00:00:365,000 --> 00:00:370,000
 the other shakes better out there it's really the bass protein that's

75
00:00:370,000 --> 00:00:375,000
 available and so what it is it's a it's 100 percent I'm

76
00:00:375,000 --> 00:00:380,000
 denatured grasp anyway protein so everybody asks what does that mean right

77
00:00:380,000 --> 00:00:385,000
 you know let's break it down into layman's terms so people can

78
00:00:385,000 --> 00:00:390,000
 understand it. So the grass fed components means and that the protein

79
00:00:390,000 --> 00:00:395,000
 sources not been injected with any any type of toxins at all

80
00:00:395,000 --> 00:00:400,000
 and so. That you don't have any antibiotics or steroids or hormones

81
00:00:400,000 --> 00:00:405,000
 or anything that have gone into them whatsoever enough protein source and

82
00:00:405,000 --> 00:00:410,000
 then to undo natured piece is you know what the process so

83
00:00:410,000 --> 00:00:415,000
 that were really extracting from the protein source. So without process you

84
00:00:415,000 --> 00:00:420,000
 can always lose a lot of the protein structures that then help

85
00:00:420,000 --> 00:00:425,000
 you build the muscle and so what happens is is that you

86
00:00:425,000 --> 00:00:430,000
 know that type of protein can help you build you know that

87
00:00:430,000 --> 00:00:435,000
 lean muscle when it comes to toxicities you know we want to

88
00:00:435,000 --> 00:00:440,000
 be utilizing something that doesn't have a lot of toxins in it

89
00:00:440,000 --> 00:00:445,000
 so that's why we focus on the clean eating aspect and we

90
00:00:445,000 --> 00:00:450,000
 talk about the grass bad aspect of it you know the reason
